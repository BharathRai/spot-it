## Usage and Setup
There are two ways to use this application: as an end-user on the deployed website, or as a developer running it locally.

### For End-Users (Using the Live App)
To use the live application, you need to provide your own Spotify API keys. This ensures the application only has permission to access your library while you are using it.

Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

Log in and click "Create app". Give it any name and description (e.g., "Spot-IT Tool").

Once created, you will see your Client ID and a button to show your Client Secret. Keep this page open.

Go to the Spot-IT live application URL. The login page will show you a Redirect URI that you must copy.

It will look something like this: https://spot-it-backend.onrender.com/auth/callback

Go back to your Spotify Developer Dashboard and click "Edit settings". Paste the copied Redirect URI into the "Redirect URIs" field, click "Add", and then "Save".

Now, copy your Client ID and Client Secret from the Spotify dashboard and paste them into the form on the Spot-IT login page.

Click "Configure Credentials" and then log in!
